How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
  I can ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure by following industry best practices and thoroughly testing. This includes using a CICD pipeline to ensure that my code passes all test and linting stages. Both black-box and white-box testing is used to ensure that software requirements are accounted for, and the developed code is robust enough to handle both valid and invalid inputs.
How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
	I interpret user needs through requirement gathering techniques like meetings and surveys. Once the software requirements are gathered and agreed upon, they can be turned into tasks that will produce implemented code. 
How do I approach designing software?
	I approach designing software by gathering requirements and basing design decisions on these requirements. Once a design is in place, I can begin planning the implementation. This process includes creating tasks and determining dependencies. These determine the order in which tasks can be accomplished. Testing and security considerations are included at every step of this process.
